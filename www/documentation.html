<h1> Getting started with KPHP </h1>
<h3> Preliminary: the K tools </h3>
		<p>
		The K framework comes as a bundle of tools. The most important of them are 
		<code> kompile </code> and <code> krun </code>.		
		</p>
		
		<p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<code> kompile </code> takes a <code> k </code> definition as input and
				compiles it into a Maude specification. 
			</li>
		
			<li>
				<code> krun </code> is then invoked in order to "run" the definition, by providing
				as input the program to be run, the parser to be used, and many additional 
				parameters depending on the particular use (which may include an LTL 
				formula to be model checked, the content of a given cell, a path condition 
				for symbolic execution and so on).
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		Since <code> krun </code> can be used in so many scenarios, its usage tends to 
		become verbose. 
		For this reason, we are planning to provide wrappers for the most common use-cases.
		At the moment we only provide the <code> kphp </code> command, which provide 
		a shortcut for simply running a script. The idea is that a PHP script can be 
		executed on the command line by writing 
		
		</br> </br>
		<code> kphp myScript.php </code>
		
		For all other cases (model checking and symbolic execution) we use the K 
		toolchain directly.
		
		</p>
		
	<h3> Step-by-step examples </h3>
		<p>
			<b> Preliminary note: </b> All the example commands shown here and in the comments in the examples
			are meant to be executed in the <code> kphp </code> source folder.
		</p>
		
		<h4> Example 1: Running a PHP program with the KPHP interpreter </h4>
			<p>
				The simplest scenario consists in running PHP code with the KPHP
				interpreter.
				
				<ol>
					<li> 
						Compile kphp for execution: 
						<code>
							kompile php.k
						</code>
					</li>
					<li>
						Invoke the <code> kphp </code> command: 
						<code>
							scripts/kphp helloworld.php
						</code>
					</li>
				</ol>
					
				This should output something like:
				 </br>
				<code> </br>
					Hello world! </br>
					This is kphp </br>
				</code>
			</p>	
						
			In order to show the final configuration 
			(i.e. the final state) use the 
			<code> --config </code> option: 
			</br></br>
			<code> scripts/kphp helloworld.php --config</code> </br> </br> 
				
			The output, which consists of the program output followed 
			by the configuration in XML-like notationm, should look like this
			(note that configurations are verbose and span over multiple pages. 
			We give some details in the next subsection).
			
				
			</br></br> <img src="img/screen-1.png"> </br>
				
		<h5> Understanding configurations </h5>
			<p>
				Configurations give a complete representation of the state, by 
				displaying the contents of all the cells.
			</p>
			<p> 
				While all the cells are of course needed for the semantics, inspecting
				some, in practice, is done much more often than others.
				In particular, there are two cells we find very important: the 
				<code> k </code> cell,  containing the fragment of program to be 
				executed next,  and the <code> heap </code> cell, containing... 
				Yes, the heap. 
			</p>
				
			<p>
				In normal conditions, the <code> k </code> cell should be empty at 
				the end of the execution. This means that the code didn't get stuck 
				(note that <code> .K </code> means "empty").
					
				</br> </br>
				<img src="img/screen-2.png"> </br>
					
				Some other times, however,  the program may get stuck 
				(either for a bug in the semantics or because the construct that 
				is at the top of the <code> k </code> cell doesn't have a semantics yet).
				This is easily detected by manually inspecting the <code> k </code>
				cell.
			</p>
				
			<p>
				Another important cell is the <code> heap </code> cell, which 
				represent the content of the memory, including the values of all 
				variables, array members, objects etc. 
				
				</br> </br>	
				<img src="img/screen-3.png"> </br>
				
				Note that, in KPHP, the heap not only contains the values of the 
				variables, but also the scopes (or symbol tables) which are represented
				as normal arrays (from whose, in principle, are indistinguishable).
				
				For example, in the previous screenshot, the memory cell marked 
				<code> #symLoc(1) </code> contains (a subset of) the superglobals, 
				while the cell marked <code> #symLoc(3) </code> contains the global 
				variables (in the example program, there was one global variable called
				<code> $name </code>.
				
				Following the same principle, when calling a function or a method a 
				new local scope is created (as an array) and stored somewhere in the heap.
				
				The <code> scopes </code> cell stores, at any time, the locations of 
				the scopes. In particular, the <code> currentScope </code>
				is initially equal to the global scope but is updated to 
				when entering a function body.
				
				</br> </br>

		<h5> Heap-Pretty-Print: pretty printing configurations </h5>
			<p>
			We provide a small tool, <code> HeapPP </code>, to pretty print configurations. It takes an 
			XML file containing a configuration as input, and outputs a 
			GraphViz (*.gv) file with the same name, containing a pretty-print 
			representation of the relevant part of the configuration 
			(i.e. we currently show only the heap plus defined functions and classses).
			</p>
			
			<p>
			The utility can be found in the <code> heap-pretty-print </code> folder under
			the main KPHP source folder.
			Please refere to the README file there for instructions.
			</p>
			
			<p> 
			To give an idea of what's the output looks like, 
			here is a (cropped) screenshot (as configurations tends to be very verbose, 
			this diagrams tends to be too).
			</p>
			
			</br> </br>

		<h4> Example 2: simple LTL model checking </h4>
			<p>
				<b> NOTE: </b> there is currently an issue with the K tools which 
				causes an exception to be thrown when checking a false LTL property on a program 
				which prints some output on <code> stdout </code>. 
				As a temporary solution, it is necessary to disable printing on <code> stdout </code>. 
				This is simply done as follow: 
				<ol>
					<li> open the <code> configuration.k </code> file </li>
					<li> 
						remove/comment the string <code> stream="stdout" </code> which is inside
				 		the "out" cell. 
				 	</li>
				</ol>
				This will disable printing on <code> stdout </code> (note that the output of the
				program will still be present in the <code> out </code> cell, which can be manually 
				inspected in case of necessity.  
				Decomment the string again to restore normal output.
			</p>
		
			In general, here are the steps to be taken to enable LTL model checking:
			
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p> 
						the semantics must be compiled with a 
						<code> --transition </code> option followed by 
						one or more tags, specifying the set of rules we 
						wish to consider transitions.
						For most immediate uses, we found it pratical to 
						use the set of rules marked with the 
						<code> [step] </code> tag as the set of transitions
						(and so does our examples from the paper): 
						
						</br> </br>
						<code>
							kompile php.k --transition="step"
						</code>
					</p>
		
					<p> 
						However, any number of tags can be used, 
						each combination of tags identifying a different 
						set of transition rules and consequently 
						a different notion of observable program state. 
						For example, the command 
						
						<code>
							kompile php.k --transition="step internal"
						</code>
						will tell the compiler to also consider 
						<code> [internal] </code> rules as transitions. 
					</p>
					
				</li>
		
				<li>
					Invoke <code> krun </code> with an LTL formula as aditional input:
					</br> </br>
					<code>
						krun --parser="java -jar parser/parser.jar" examples/hello-world-ltl.php --ltlmc="LtlTrue"
					</code>
					</br> </br>
					
					Alternatively, it is also possible to write the same LTL formula in a file:
					<code>
						krun --parser="java -jar parser/parser.jar" examples/hello-world-ltl.php --ltlmc helloLTL.txt
					</code> </br>
					<p>
					The output of this simple example should be <code> True </code>
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>
			In general, the outcome can be:
				<ul>
					<li> 
						<code> True </code>, meaning that the property holds
					</li>
					<li>
						A counterexample given as a sequence of configurations 
						(i.e. the representation of a program execution for which the 
						property is violated).
					</li>
					<li>
						Non termination 
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h4> Symbolic Execution </h4>

				<p>
				Symbolic execution must be explicitly enabled via the <code> 
				kompile </code> command:
				
				</br> </br>
				<code>
					kompile php.k --backend symbolic
				</code> 
				</br> </br>
				
				It is possible to specify (similarly as when compiling with 
				<code> --transition </code>) which rules we want to "augment" for 
				symbolic executions, by using the 
				<code> --symbolic-rules </code> command. By default (i.e. if the 
				option is not specified) all rules are compiled for symbolic 
				execution. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				After the semantics have been compiled for symbolic execution, it is 
				possible to execute programs symbolically via the <code> krun </code> 
				command. In addition to the program to be run and the parser, we
				also have to provide
					
					<ul>
						<li>
							An initial path condition: this is done via the option 
							<code> -cPC=[PATH CONDITION] </code>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<p>
							some symbolic input: this is done by manually putting some (possibly)
							symbolic values into the input buffer (i.e. the <code> IN </code> cell):
							<code> -cIN="ListItem([VALUE 1]) ... ListItem([VALUE n])".  </code>
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Also, it is also important to make sure that the input programs
							actually makes use of this symbolic data.
							For this purpose, we define an utility command called 
							<code> user_input() </code> which can be used to simulate
							arbitrary input; it works by reading the first item in the input
							buffer and returning it. E.g:
							
							</br> </br>
							<code> 
								$input = user_input();		// simulates arbitrary input 
							</code>
							</br> </br>
														 
							</p>
							
						</li>
					</ul>
				
				Let us see how this works in practice with a simple example
				(assuming you have already compiled for symbolic execution as shown above):
				
				<ol>
					<li>
						Running a program symbolically:
							</br></br>
							<code>
								krun --parser="java -jar parser/parser.jar" -cPC="true" 
						    	-cIN='ListItem(#symInt(x))' examples/hello-world-symbolic.php
							</code>
							</br></br>
							
							This should produce the program output, " <code> hello </code> ", 
							following by the confuguration augmented with a <code> PC </code> 
							cell containing the path condition:
							
							</br> </br>	
								<img src="img/screen-5.png"> </br>
								
							Note that when more than one path conditions are possible, 
							an arbitrary one is chosen unless...		
												
					</li>
						
					<li>
						Exploring all paths:
						it is possible to ask the K tool to explore the different 
						paths, and return all the possible final states 
						(according to the different path conditions) by adding 
						the <code> --search </code> option
						
						</br></br>
							<code>
								krun --parser="java -jar parser/parser.jar" -cPC="true" 
						    	-cIN='ListItem(#symInt(x))' --search examples/hello-world-symbolic.php 
							</code>
							</br></br>
							
							The output should be similar to the previous one, except 
							for the fact that two final states will be displayed 
							(i.e. one for <code> $x == 0 </code> and one for its 
							negation)
					</li>
					
				</ol>
				
				</p>
