Substitution has been reimplemented in the meanwhile, where the fresh
variables are resolved locally.  So there is no global counter for
fresh variables anymore, and fewer variable renamings take place.

Marking the beta-reduction rule with [anywhere] will give us the
conventional lambda-calculus.  A new lesson needs to be added about
that.
