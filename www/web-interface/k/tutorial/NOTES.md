Global changes that need to be made:

* Replace `when` in rules with `requires`

Things to revise each time the structure of the tutorial changes:

* `1_k\3_lambda++\lesson_1\README.md` refers to Lesson 8, Tutorial 1
* `1_k\3_lambda++\lesson_2\README.md` Lesson 1, Tutorial 1
* `1_k\3_lambda++\lesson_3\README.md` refers to Lesson 7, Tutorial 1
* `1_k\3_lambda++\lesson_4\README.md` refers to Lesson 1
* `1_k\3_lambda++\lesson_5\README.md` refers to Lesson 4, Lesson 8 and Lesson 7 of Tutorial 1
* `1_k\3_lambda++\lesson_6\README.md` refers to Parts 3 and 4 of the tutorial
* `1_k\4_imp++\lesson_1\README.md` refers to Lesson 4, Tutorial 2; also Tutorial 3 (at the end)
* `1_k\4_imp++\lesson_5\README.md` refers to Lesson 4
* `1_k\4_imp++\lesson_6\README.md` refers to Lesson 3
* `1_k\4_imp++\lesson_7\README.md` refers to Lesson 1, 6
* `1_k\5_types\lesson_1\README.md` refers to Part 4
* `1_k\5_types\lesson_3\README.md` refers to Part 1
* `1_k\5_types\lesson_4\README.md` refers to Part 1, and to Lessons 2 and 3
* `1_k\5_types\lesson_5\README.md` refers to Lessons 4, 3, 2
* `1_k\5_types\lesson_6\README.md` refers to Lesson 5
* `1_k\5_types\lesson_7\README.md` refers to Lesson 4, 8, 9
* `1_k\5_types\lesson_8\README.md` refers to Lessons 5, 7
* `1_k\5_types\lesson_9\README.md` refers to Lessons 8, 5, 7, 4
* 

`1_k\4_imp++\lesson_2\README.md` states "generates a term of the form
`symNat(n)` of sort `Nat`", but the representation of symbolic numbers may
have changed

Describe/explain/justify the terminology "the `<k/>` cell" as opposed to "the `k` cell".

It would be a good idea to make the README files self contained, that is,
to include the entire lang.k code in them, spread over the entire README, as things
are discussed.

`1_k\5_types\lesson_4\README.md` refers to *polymorphism*, but some may say that is not precisely 
polymorphism, because the types are not universally quantified.  Explain that better.
