This programs computes the sum of the first n numbers.
Since n is constrained by the condition 0 <= n <= 3 the symbolic
execution of this program will chose a value for n in [0,3] interval.

To find all possible executions of this program use the `--search` option
for krun. This will display all possible configurations containing possible 
values for program variables.
