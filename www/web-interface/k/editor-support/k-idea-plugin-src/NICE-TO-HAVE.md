## Features nice to have

- Treating builtin functions like regular functions, navigation support. Just like JDK classes are threated like regular classes by Java IDE.
- Highlighting of rule LHS/RHS when the arrow => is selected. LHS could have a reddish background color and RHS a blueish. Inspired from the highlighting of parentheses.
- Support for javadoc tags @param, @return, @see within documentation comments.
- Code formatting. This is the only major feature from the tutorial that was not implemented. Both the format adopted in the tutorial and the one from java semantics should be supported. Should be highly configurable.
- Native integration with kompile/krun. Here we can also have navigation from error messages to the target code line.
- Autocomplete in various contexts
- Coloring the cells according to their color attribute.
