our notes:

- nondeterminism across invocations (all memeory in mem!)
- in extended, show 2|array  
  - for object fields, do like in basic verison, but showing also loc
    ["x" | protected | 19]

not said
- options work fine, would be nice to be able to ignore them, and to provide also input/output file names
- all array gets orange if isref (should we ignore)?
  - why refcount is 2 in extended output? we should have fixed in semantics
(hide refocunt)
